"""auditor.py — daily repo health & drift audit. Read-only.

See docs/AUDITOR.md for the full contract. Summary of the rules that matter:

  * This tool NEVER edits code, never closes/merges anything, and never adds a
    claimable-status label. Its only writes are (a) GitHub issues/comments/labels
    and (b) one appended line in this repo's own status_log.jsonl.
  * Every finding is held for human review via the ``on-hold`` label plus
    ``auditor:proposed`` or ``auditor:revise``. Nothing is auto-actioned.
  * The run is idempotent and checkpointed: it exits silently if HEAD has not
    moved since the last successful run, and on failure it does not advance the
    checkpoint so the same range is retried.
  * Analysis is deterministic (no LLM). That is a deliberate choice: every check
    below is a mechanical fact about the tree, and a deterministic run costs no
    tokens, cannot hallucinate, and is safe to re-trigger.

Design note: findings are computed in full BEFORE anything is written, and the
GitHub writes only begin once every check has completed. That gives the
"either complete the run's output or produce nothing" property required by the
spec for the common failure mode (a check crashing mid-run).

Usage:
    python3 tooling/auditor.py --repo philipdallen/Maith --dry-run
    python3 tooling/auditor.py --repo philipdallen/Maith
    python3 tooling/auditor.py --repo philipdallen/Maith --force   # ignore checkpoint

Exit codes: 0 = ran or skipped cleanly; 1 = real error (checkpoint not advanced).
